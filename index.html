        <img src="assets/images/Profile-pic.jpg" alt="profile-pic" id="profile-pic">

        <p>My name is James, I am a 23 year old financial trader employed by LPL Financial in Charlotte, NC. I am originally
            from Schuylkill Haven, PA and moved south when I was 17. I grew up a golfer, playing in multiple events for Team
            USA and competing all around the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean. </p>

        <p>I am taking the Full-Stack Web Development Course through UNC Charlotte to give me a fundamental understanding of
            how coding software operates and eventually be able to tie it into my career as a financial trader. I plan to
            learn algorithmic trading after this course and tie it into the technical analysis skills I have developed as
            a trader. Feel free to check out my site and send me a message anytime! Cheers!</p>
