            <p>
                My name is James, I am a 23 year old financial trader employed by LPL Financial in Charlotte, NC. I am originally from Schuylkill
                Haven, PA and moved south when I was 17. I grew up a golfer, playing in multiple events for Team USA and
                competing all around the United States, Canada, and the Caribbean.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am taking the Full-Stack Web Development Course through UNC Charlotte to give me a fundamental understanding of how coding
                software operates and eventually be able to tie it into my career as a financial trader. I plan to learn
                algorithmic trading after this course and tie it into the technical analysis skills I have developed as a
                trader. Feel free to check out my site and send me a message anytime! Cheers!
